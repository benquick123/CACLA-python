# project_robotic_farkas

<b> Initial commit </b>

Run *simpleTest.py* with V-REP open to see if this works for you.

<b> First scene </b>

In this commit the first scene is added featuring simple sphere, robotic arm and main_camera (*test.py*).

The following questions seem relevant:
- What exactly is the input that our system will recieve? Is it necessary to have 2 cameras on scene, or is our goal 
just to learn the arm based on simple input (e.g. sphere coordinates relative to camera (eyes)) and visual preprocessing (that we don't 
have to do) will take care fo the rest?
- Is feedback arm or camera driven? What I mean by that is if we should observe arm location based on camera input or 
arm position (or maybe both)?
- Should we use the actual robotic arm that will be used in experiments?
